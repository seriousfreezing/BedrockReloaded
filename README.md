Bedrock Reloaded is a modpack designed to be an alternative to Bedrock edition. It already includes all possible Bedrock features, such as: Ray-Tracing based shaders, improved interfaces, fade in when generating chunks, improved particles, support for controls and touchscreen, support for Bedrock servers and much more.
  
All of these features are always well planned and implemented to be as optimized and lightweight as possible - along with a list of mods that add a huge improvement to the game's overall performance.

# 🤔Why not use Bedrock?
### ✨Refined
Have a more pleasant experience - no nasty features and fewer bugs.

### 🕊️Freedom
Have the possibility to add thousands of mods, plugins, shaders and much more! (many of them without having to pay!)

### 🚫Data collection
Don't have Mojang/Microsoft collecting your data as you play.

### 🧩 Modular
You can remove any feature you don't want with less than a few clicks.

### ⚙️Open-source
Most of the features used are open-source - which allows for greater reliability and repair.
